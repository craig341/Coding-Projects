Released from her chains
the maiden and the prize and the reason of this task steps forwards.

(The hero) himself washed his victorious hands with gathered sea water,
and so that the snake-bearing head might not suffer an injury from the hard sand
he made the ground soft with leaves and he spread out seaweed that grew beneath the surface
then he placed on that the head of Medusa, daughter of Phorcys.

The fresh seaweed, alive even now and with an absorbent core
drew in the strength of the monster and hardened at its touch
and felt a new rigidity in its branches and foliage.

But the nymphs tested this amazing (made) thing
and rejoiced (when) the same thing happened with more seaweed
and the seaweed from them, scattered across the waves repeated (the action).

Now the same nature remains for the red coral,
they become hard at the touch of air, and that which
was (pliant) seaweed in the water, becomes a rock above it.
