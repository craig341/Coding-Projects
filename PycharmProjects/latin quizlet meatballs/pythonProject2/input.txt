Stranger, what I have to say is brief; stand still and read it through.
Here is the not beautiful tomb of a beautiful woman.
Her parents named her Claudia.

She loved her husband with all her heart.
She bore two sons: of these one
she leaves on earth, the other she placed beneath the earth.

With charming conversation, and indeed with elegant step,
she looked after the house, she spun wool.
I have spoken. Go on your way.
