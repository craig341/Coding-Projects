Is any woman today ashamed of being divorced,

now that some distinguished and noble ladies count their age

not by the number of the consuls

but by that of their husbands

(now that) they leave (their homes) in order to marry (again),

and marry not only in order to be divorced?



There was a fear of that

(only) so long as it was unusual;



now that no official news is complete without a divorce,

women have learnt to do what they hear about so often



Is there any longer embarrassment at adultery,

now that things have reached the point

that no woman keeps a husband except to annoy her lover?



Chastity is (merely) proof of ugliness.

What woman will you find so wretched, so undesirable,

that for her a single pair of lovers is sufficient,

unless she (means to) share the hours (of the day) between several

and the day is not long enough for all of them,

(or) unless she has taken an excursion in the company of one

and stayed (the night) with another?

A woman is foolish and old-fashioned

if she doesn't know that (having just) one lover is known as marriage
